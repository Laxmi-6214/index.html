    <p>Four years at SVU gave us more than just a degree — it gave us memories that will stay forever. From endless fights and silly misunderstandings to compromises filled with sorry’s and thank you’s, every moment shaped our friendship. We celebrated birthdays like festivals, bunked classes without guilt, laughed during attendance proxy, and watched movies while classes were going on. There were days of stress, late-night talks, and moments when we annoyed each other the most — but still stood together every single time.
This journey was not perfect, but it was real. Every photo, every video, and every song here holds a piece of our story — the laughter, the madness, and the unbreakable bond we built over these four years. SVU was the place, but we were the magic.</p>

    As a group of friends, this temple visit was not just about prayers, but about togetherness. Dressed in simplicity and smiles, we walked side by side, leaving behind our worries and sharing peaceful moments. In the quiet presence of faith, our bond felt stronger — hearts lighter, laughter softer, and friendship deeper. This day reminded us that friendship isn’t only about fun and madness, but also about standing together in calm moments, seeking blessings, and creating memories that stay pure forever.
  This temple visit became a special moment in our friendship journey as a group of girls walking together with smiles and peaceful hearts. Away from college stress and daily noise, we found calmness in each other’s presence and strength in togetherness. From getting ready together to teasing and clicking pictures, every small moment felt meaningful. Sharing prayers side by side made our bond show a softer and deeper side. The silence of the temple brought us closer in a different way. We laughed quietly, spoke less, and felt more. It reminded us that friendship is not only about fun and madness but also about peace and faith. Every step we took felt lighter with friends beside us. These moments may seem simple, but they hold deep meaning. Truly grateful and blessed to share such pure memories with my girls. 🙏💖

<p>We were more than just a group of classmates — we were a crazy mix of girls and boys who turned every corner of college into a memory. From chilling inside classrooms during free hours to laughing in labs while classes were still going on, we never missed a chance to enjoy the moment. The hostel terrace became our favorite spot for late-night talks, jokes, and endless laughter, while multiple vacations brought us even closer with shared journeys and unforgettable stories. The canteen was our everyday hangout, where chai, tiffins, and snacks tasted better because they were shared together. And then came the birthdays — celebrated in places where students were clearly forbidden, making it funny, risky, and unforgettable. Cutting cakes in silence, hiding from wardens, and laughing afterward made it feel adventurous. It wasn’t about breaking rules, but about the love we had for each other. Even in the smallest moments, our friendship felt bold, real, and full of life. These memories didn’t just happen — we lived them together, and they will stay with us forever. 💙✨</p>

<h3><strong><em>L</em>aughs, <em>L</em>ipsticks & <em>L</em>ots of Drama</strong></h3>
 
<p>Laughs, lipsticks, and lots of drama perfectly describe our funniest moments together. What started as simple makeup turned into complete chaos and endless laughter. We became makeup artists for each other, with no rules and no skills, only confidence. Lipsticks went beyond lips, blush became over-blush, and mirrors were filled with funny faces. Every mistake made us laugh harder instead of fixing it. There was teasing, dramatic reactions, and nonstop jokes. Even the boys couldn’t stop laughing at our experiments. Those moments had no filters, no pressure — just pure fun. We forgot about classes, stress, and everything else. The classroom turned into our mini makeover studio. These silly memories became some of the most loved ones. They remind us that friendship is about being comfortable enough to look crazy together. Truly priceless moments that still make us smile. 💖😄</p>

<h3><strong><em>B</em>loopers, <em>G</em>iggles & <em>M</em>emes</strong></h3>

<p>One of our funniest moments was making that Instagram reel that went totally viral among our friends! It started as a silly idea, just a random trend we saw online, but quickly turned into chaos and laughter. Each of us tried to act serious, but no one could keep a straight face. The timing was all over the place, lines were forgotten, and improvisation ruled the day. Between giggles, bloopers, and repeated takes, we laughed until our stomachs hurt. Even small props and funny expressions added extra drama. The boys joined in, making it even crazier, while the girls added their own hilarious twists. By the end, we had a reel full of energy, jokes, and pure friendship vibes. Watching it later made us laugh all over again. That little 15-second video captured years of fun, craziness, and the bond we share. It wasn’t just a reel — it was a memory we’ll treasure forever. Every like, comment, and share reminded us of how lucky we are to have each other. These moments prove that friendship is best when it’s fun, silly, and totally unapologetic. 💖😂</p>

<p>Time really didn’t wait for us… one moment we were laughing without a care, dreaming big with childish hearts, and the next moment life quietly made us grow up. 🌱⏳
Somewhere between responsibilities and silence, we lost those endless talks, those silly fights, those unforgettable memories.
No matter how far we are or how busy life gets, a part of me still lives in those days with you all. 💭✨
I miss us. I miss you guys. More than you’ll ever know. 💔🤍</p>
